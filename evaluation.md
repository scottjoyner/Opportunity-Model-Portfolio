# Vertcoin Indie Game Store
**One Line Pitch:** Steam store for Indie Game Developers and gamers using a new currency as payment.
**Business Summary:** The gaming industry is booming, and so are all the gamers who love trying out new games. The number of individuals interested in playing video games has only increased in the pandemic. The goal is to develop a store where small Game Studios can release their games to a global audience of gamers, and get paid better for the work they do.  
**Management:** Scott Joyner will serve as the CEO and lead developer of the application, any marketing campaigns will be advertized by affliates, and volunteers from the community.
**Customer Problem:** Gamers love video games, but games are getting expensive, wouldn't it be nice if they could start to aquire currencies while they were not playing games, with all the graphics cards and raw compute power availible, these gamers could start securing the payment network they use to buy new games. For their work to secure the network, gamers could use their rewards to pay for more games, and fund the developers they love.
**Product and Services:** The product is a service, an online hub where games can be bought, much like the steam store, the online store will allow users to browse games and view sneak peeks of new upcoming games in development.
**Customer Base:** The customer base is gamers, anyone who has a PC at home with a graphics card can start to participate in the project. The crypto mining community has used GPU's to mine cryptocurrencies for a number of years now, and the target audience for cryptomining has been gamers who are willing to help secure the network and are rewarded with crypto. 
**Sales and Marketing Strategey:** The marketing will focus on the Vertcoin mining community, this community is a community of gamers who use their graphics cards to secure the network.
**Business Model:** The model would be multifaceted, as their will be both sellers and buyers on the platform, the marketplace will allow all game developers to list their games for sale and upload their games to the website, while users can go in and purchase the games with their newly minned crypto. 
**Competitors:** Steam is the most popular gaming platform for gamers everywhere; however, there are other competitors.
**Competitive Advantage/Differentiaing Factors:** To differentiate myself from other companies like this I will market this as a community of users. The way you aquire the currency on the site will be dependant on you mining and verifying transactions on the payment network, which as more users start using the platform the more robust the community and network power will become.

# Canvas
**Key Partners:** Vertcoin foundation for secure payments and accounting, Digital Ocean for server uptime and storing games for the platform. Gamers and GPU's for the community.
**Key Activities:** Providing a game library of inde games where users can discover new games, new developer projects, and suport the ones they are passionate about. 
**Key Resources:** Vertcoin mining, the network popularity will increase in due time.
**Value Proposition:** Creating a "competitive development landscape for gamers to decide what they like and reward creators for their projects.
**Customer Relationships:** Customers are the most important part of this proposition, as they are the heart of the network.
**Channels:** Web app for gamers to browse new games and projects they would like to fund.
**Cost Strucutre:** The costs are relatively small, as the website will cost under $100 / month for uptime, data storage will be relatively cheap too, depending on the game size.
**Revanue Streams:** Subscription to the bag of games that will be free for a given period of time, royalties paid to the platform to keep the website up and running. App stores like the Apple app store charge 30% in royalties to the company before the developer sees any profits, I would like to reduce this to 5% or less, preferably 1% just to account for overhead costs of keeping the server uptime.
